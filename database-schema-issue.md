## 🎯 Feature Description

Design and implement database schema updates to support user management and authentication. This includes creating user tables, role definitions, and the necessary relationships to integrate with Azure AD B2C while maintaining local user data for business operations.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User table is created with proper fields and constraints
- [ ] Role table is implemented with three-tier system (Read-Only, Read-Write, Admin)
- [ ] UserRole relationship table is established
- [ ] Database migration scripts are created and tested
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are properly configured
- [ ] Indexes are added for optimal query performance
- [ ] Sample data includes test users with different roles

## 🔗 Related Issues

- Parent: #2 (Phase 1: Authentication Foundation & Azure Setup)
- Dependencies: #3 (Azure AD B2C setup for user ID format)
- Blockers: None

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Store only essential user information locally (no passwords - handled by B2C)
- Implement proper data encryption for sensitive fields
- Set up audit trail for user role changes
- Ensure GDPR compliance with minimal data collection
- Configure proper database access permissions
- Implement soft delete for user records (data retention)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**
- Test Entity Framework models and relationships
- Validate data constraints and validations
- Test migration scripts up and down

**Integration Testing**  
- Test user creation with B2C integration
- Validate role assignment and permission checking
- Test database operations with realistic data volumes

**Data Testing**
- Verify referential integrity
- Test performance with sample data
- Validate migration rollback scenarios

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

- Document database schema design and relationships
- Create migration guide and rollback procedures
- Update Entity Framework model documentation
- Document role-based permission matrix

## 🔧 Implementation Tasks

### Database Schema Design
- [ ] Design User table with Azure B2C ObjectId integration
- [ ] Create Role table with predefined roles
- [ ] Design UserRole junction table for many-to-many relationships
- [ ] Add audit fields (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, DeletedAt)

### Entity Framework Updates
- [ ] Create User, Role, and UserRole entity models
- [ ] Update DbContext with new entities and relationships
- [ ] Configure entity relationships and constraints
- [ ] Add data annotations for validation

### Migration Implementation
- [ ] Create database migration for new tables
- [ ] Add seed data for default roles
- [ ] Test migration on development database
- [ ] Create rollback migration if needed

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Optimize foreign key relationships
- [ ] Test query performance with sample data

✅ All tests pass successfully

## 💾 Database Schema Overview

```sql
-- Users table (local business data, linked to B2C)
Users: Id, AzureB2CObjectId, Email, FirstName, LastName, CompanyName, 
       CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, DeletedAt

-- Roles table (predefined role definitions)
Roles: Id, Name, Description, Permissions, CreatedAt

-- UserRoles junction table (many-to-many relationship)
UserRoles: UserId, RoleId, AssignedAt, AssignedBy
```
