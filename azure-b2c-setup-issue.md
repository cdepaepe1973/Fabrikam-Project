## 🎯 Feature Description

Set up Azure Active Directory B2C tenant and configure authentication policies for the Fabrikam Project. This includes creating the B2C tenant, configuring user flows for registration and login, and establishing the foundation for secure authentication.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Azure AD B2C tenant is created and configured
- [ ] User registration flow is set up with required fields (email, first name, last name)
- [ ] User login flow is configured with email/password authentication
- [ ] Password reset flow is implemented
- [ ] B2C tenant is integrated with Fabrikam API configuration
- [ ] JWT token configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Test users can be created and authenticated successfully

## 🔗 Related Issues

- Parent: #2 (Phase 1: Authentication Foundation & Azure Setup)
- Dependencies: None (foundational task)
- Blockers: Requires Azure subscription access

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Configure strong password policies (minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements)
- Enable account lockout protection after failed attempts
- Set up proper token expiration times (15 minutes access, 7 days refresh)
- Configure HTTPS-only endpoints for all authentication flows
- Enable audit logging for all authentication events
- Set up conditional access policies for enhanced security

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing**
- Test user registration flow with various input scenarios
- Verify login functionality with valid and invalid credentials
- Test password reset flow end-to-end
- Validate JWT token generation and claims

**Automated Testing**
- Integration tests for B2C authentication flows
- Token validation testing
- Error handling validation for authentication failures

**Security Testing**
- Verify HTTPS enforcement
- Test rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Validate token security and expiration handling

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

- Document B2C tenant configuration steps
- Create developer guide for authentication integration
- Update API documentation with authentication requirements
- Document environment variables and configuration settings

## 🔧 Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Create Azure AD B2C tenant in Azure portal
- [ ] Configure user registration user flow
- [ ] Configure user login user flow  
- [ ] Set up password reset user flow
- [ ] Configure JWT token settings and claims
- [ ] Update FabrikamApi configuration for B2C integration
- [ ] Create test users for validation
- [ ] Document configuration steps and settings
