## 📁 **Document Organization**

This documentation is organized by **user goals** rather than technical categories. Each section is designed to get you from "I want to..." to "Done!" as quickly as possible.

**Current folder structure:**

```
docs/
├── README.md                   # This navigation guide
├── getting-started/            # New contributor onboarding
├── demos/                      # Demo guides and validation
├── development/                # Development workflow and tools
│   └── testing/                # Testing documentation
├── future-features/            # Future roadmap items

├── architecture/               # Technical architecture and design
└── assets/                     # Images and supporting files
```

**Philosophy:** Each document should be **actionable** and **complete** - you shouldn't need to jump between multiple docs to accomplish a single goal.
