## 🎯 Phase 1: Authentication Foundation & Azure Setup

This phase establishes the foundational authentication infrastructure for the Fabrikam Project, implementing secure user registration, login, and role-based access control.

### 📋 Phase 1 Deliverables

**🏗️ Infrastructure Setup**
- [ ] Azure AD B2C tenant configuration and policies
- [ ] Database schema updates for user management  
- [ ] JWT token infrastructure implementation
- [ ] Basic API authentication middleware setup

**🔐 Core Authentication Features**
- [ ] User registration endpoint with validation
- [ ] Login/logout functionality with secure session management
- [ ] Password reset and account recovery flows
- [ ] Role-based access control foundation (Read-Only, Read-Write, Admin)

**🛡️ Security Implementation**
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement for all authentication endpoints
- [ ] Secure token storage and validation mechanisms
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for auth forms
- [ ] Rate limiting for authentication attempts

**🧪 Testing & Validation**
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication logic
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end auth flows
- [ ] Security testing for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance testing for auth endpoints

### 🛡️ Security Requirements

- **Privacy-First Design**: Minimal data collection following GDPR principles
- **Secure Token Management**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce complexity requirements and breach detection
- **Account Security**: Multi-factor authentication ready, account lockout protection

### 📊 Success Criteria

✅ **Functional Requirements**
- Users can successfully register new accounts
- Users can login and logout securely
- JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- Basic role permissions are correctly enforced
- All authentication endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes

✅ **Security Requirements**
- No authentication vulnerabilities in security scan
- All sensitive data is properly encrypted
- Authentication flows follow industry best practices
- Integration with Azure AD B2C is secure and reliable

✅ **Testing Requirements**
- >90% code coverage for authentication modules
- All integration tests pass consistently
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<200ms auth response)
- Security scan passes with no critical issues

### 🗓️ Implementation Timeline

**Week 1 (Jul 26 - Aug 2)**
- Azure AD B2C setup and configuration
- Database schema design and implementation
- Basic JWT infrastructure

**Week 2 (Aug 2 - Aug 9)**  
- API endpoints implementation
- Role-based access control
- Testing and security validation

**Target Completion**: August 9, 2025
