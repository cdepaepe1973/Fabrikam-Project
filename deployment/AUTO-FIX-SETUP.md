# 🤖 Deploy Auto-Fix CI/CD Automation

## Quick Setup

This automation will automatically fix Azure Portal-generated CI/CD workflows to work properly with the Fabrikam monorepo structure.

### What It Does

- 🔍 **Detects** Azure Portal-generated workflows (naming pattern: `*_fabrikam-*-dev-*.yml`)
- 🛠️ **Fixes** generic build commands to use specific project paths
- 💾 **Commits** optimized workflows automatically  
- 🚀 **Enables** successful deployments without manual intervention

### Deployment

1. **Commit the automation workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/auto-fix-cicd.yml
   git commit -m "🤖 Add automated CI/CD workflow optimization

   - Auto-detects Azure Portal-generated workflows
   - Applies CIPP-inspired monorepo fixes
   - Enables zero-touch workflow optimization
   - Following proven enterprise deployment patterns"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/davebirr/Fabrikam-Project/actions) tab
   - Workflow will appear as "🤖 Auto-Fix CI/CD Workflows"

### Triggers

The automation runs automatically when:

- ✅ **Workflow Failures**: Any `*fabrikam-*` workflow fails (most common case)
- ✅ **Manual Trigger**: Use "Run workflow" button in GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Force Fix**: Manual trigger with "force fix" option enabled

### User Experience

**Before Automation:**
1. Setup CI/CD in Azure Portal (5 min)
2. Workflow fails due to monorepo paths ❌
3. Manually edit workflow files (10-15 min)
4. Test and troubleshoot (5-10 min)
5. **Total: 20-30 minutes**

**After Automation:**
1. Setup CI/CD in Azure Portal (5 min)
2. Workflow fails but auto-fix triggers 🤖
3. Fixed workflows committed automatically (30 seconds)
4. Next run succeeds ✅
5. **Total: 5-6 minutes**

### What Gets Fixed

#### API Workflows
```yaml
# Before (Azure Portal generates):
- name: Build with dotnet
  run: dotnet build --configuration Release

# After (Auto-fix applies):  
- name: Build with dotnet
  run: dotnet build FabrikamApi/src/FabrikamApi.csproj --configuration Release
```

#### MCP Workflows
```yaml
# Before (Azure Portal generates):
- name: dotnet publish
  run: dotnet publish -c Release -o ${{env.DOTNET_ROOT}}/myapp

# After (Auto-fix applies):
- name: dotnet publish  
  run: dotnet publish FabrikamMcp/src/FabrikamMcp.csproj -c Release -o ${{env.DOTNET_ROOT}}/myapp
```

### Manual Testing

Test the automation manually:

1. Go to [Actions tab](https://github.com/davebirr/Fabrikam-Project/actions)
2. Select "🤖 Auto-Fix CI/CD Workflows"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enable "Force fix all workflows" if needed
5. Watch it optimize your workflows! ✨

### Integration with Current Deployment

This automation complements your existing setup perfectly:

- ✅ **ARM Template**: Creates infrastructure (existing)
- ✅ **Azure Portal CI/CD**: Sets up deployment pipelines (existing)  
- ✅ **Auto-Fix**: Optimizes workflows for monorepo (new! 🎉)
- ✅ **Successful Deployment**: Everything works seamlessly

### CIPP-Inspired Patterns

This automation follows the same principles that made CIPP successful with 9000+ deployments:

- 🔄 **Automatic Problem Detection**: No user monitoring required
- 🛠️ **Self-Healing**: Fixes issues without user intervention  
- 📝 **Clear Documentation**: Every fix is documented in commit messages
- 🚀 **Enterprise-Grade**: Robust error handling and logging
- ✅ **Zero-Touch Operation**: Works silently in the background

### Future Enhancements

The automation is designed to be easily extensible:

- 🎯 Add detection for more workflow patterns
- 🔧 Include additional optimization rules
- 📊 Add success rate monitoring
- 🔔 Integrate with notifications (Slack, Teams)
- 🏗️ Support more project types and structures

### Troubleshooting

If the automation doesn't work as expected:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure GitHub Actions has write access
2. **Review Logs**: Check the workflow run logs for details
3. **Manual Run**: Try triggering manually to test
4. **Pattern Check**: Verify workflow names match `*fabrikam-*` pattern

### Success Confirmation

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ Commit appears with "🤖 Auto-fix CI/CD workflows" message
- ✅ Workflow files show updated project paths
- ✅ Next CI/CD run succeeds without errors
- ✅ Azure App Services deploy successfully
