### 🏗️ Azure Resources to be Created

1. **Resource Group**: `rg-{environment-name}`
2. **App Service Plan**: Basic B1 tier for cost-effective hosting
3. **App Service**: Windows-based hosting for .NET 9.0 API
4. **Application Insights**: APM and telemetry collection
5. **Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralized logging
6. **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Secure Azure service authentication

### 🔧 Key Features

**✅ Production Ready:**
- HTTPS-only enforcement
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Secure managed identity authentication

**✅ API Optimized:**
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Swagger UI served at root URL
- .NET 9.0 runtime configuration
- Application Insights integration

**✅ Security Best Practices:**
- TLS 1.2 minimum requirement
- FTPS-only secure file transfer
- Managed identity for Azure service access
- Diagnostic logging enabled

### 🚀 Quick Deployment

To deploy your FabrikamApi to Azure:

1. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

2. **Initialize project** (from FabrikamApi directory):
   ```bash
   azd init
   ```

3. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

### 📊 Tool Versions Verified

- ✅ **Azure CLI**: 2.75.0 (up-to-date)
- ✅ **Azure Developer CLI**: 1.16.1 (functional, update available)
- ✅ **.NET SDK**: 9.0.302 (correct version for API)

### 🎯 Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:

- **API URL**: `https://app-{unique-id}.azurewebsites.net/`
- **Health Check**: `https://app-{unique-id}.azurewebsites.net/health`
- **Swagger UI**: Available at the root URL
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights dashboard in Azure Portal

### 🛡️ Deployment Validation

Pre-deployment checks **PASSED** ✅:
- ✅ Bicep templates syntactically correct
- ✅ Azure.yaml configuration valid
- ✅ Resource naming follows best practices
- ✅ Security configurations implemented
- ✅ Monitoring and logging configured
- ✅ Required outputs defined

### 📝 What Makes This Different

This deployment template includes several enhancements over basic templates:

1. **Subscription-scoped deployment** for flexibility
2. **Resource token-based naming** to avoid conflicts
3. **Comprehensive tagging** for resource management
4. **Production-grade monitoring** with Application Insights
5. **Security hardening** with managed identity
6. **Health check integration** for reliability
7. **CORS configuration** for API access

### 💡 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the API** using the health endpoint
2. **View monitoring** in Application Insights
3. **Customize CORS** settings for specific origins
4. **Scale up** App Service Plan if needed
5. **Add authentication** if required
6. **Set up CI/CD** for automated deployments
